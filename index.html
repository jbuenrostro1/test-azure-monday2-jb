    <div class="background">
    <p style="text-align:center;" style="color: white" > My name is Jazmin Buenrostro. I am a Junior at Lewis and I'm studying Computer Science + Music. I am currently the youngest of two older sisters, who go by the names of Amanda and Jackie. 
        <br>
        I was born and raised in Chicago for the first 6 years of my life, and then moved to Plainfield, IL to begin first grade. I have moved in different areas all across Plainfield, living in 5 different houses in my lifetime already.
        <br>
        I currently work at Geek Squad, where I am getting a lot of my computer experience, and I graduated from Joliet Junior College with an Associates in Arts in Music in 2020.

    <div class="background">
    <p style="text-align:center;">During my free time I like to play piano, guitar, or ukulele. I want to, at one point, get into songwriting as well. 
        <br>
    I am taking an Intro to Recording and Computer Music class at the moment which is inspiring me to want to write and record my own music. Hopefully down the road, I can explore songwriting a bit more.
